# Change File Extension

Sometimes we need to change the file extension of a file. This can be a tedious task if we have a lot of files to change. In this case, I've written a script specifically for this task. which saves more time.

## Prerequisites

To run the Python script, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use the file you can run change-extension.py or download the exe file from Releases.

- Check the file extension.
```md

-ets

```
- Change file extension
```md

-ch

```
- After entering the above two commands You must enter a file path or folder path.
```md

Enter file or folder path >>> </path/to/folder>

```
- Exit program
```md

-ext
```
## Conclusion
This Python script can save you a lot of time and effort when you need to change the extension of multiple files. You can further develop or modify this Python script in your own way.
